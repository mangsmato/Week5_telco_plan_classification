<h3> Classification Problem using sklearn</h3>
<br>
This code introduces a beginer to classification modeling using the Python sklearn library
<br>
<h3> Problem Statement </h3>
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans.
They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend
one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.
You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the
new plans. For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. 
Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. 
In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.

<h3> Solution </h3>
The company needs your help to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend
one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra
